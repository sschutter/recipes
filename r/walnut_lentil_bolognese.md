Walnut and Lentil Bolognese
-----

- 2 tbsp Olive oil
- 1 cup Grated carrots
- 1 cup Celery, minced
- 1 cup Onions, finely minced
- 1 cup Walnuts, finely chopped
- 1 cup Dried lentils (brown or green), rinsed in a fine mesh sieve
- 1 (24) oz jar Marinara
- 6 cups Water
- 1 tsp Salt

- 1 lb Wide pasta noodles, such as pappardelle or tagliatelle
Parmesan cheese or vegan parmesan cheese, optional

In a large saucepan or braiser heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the carrots, celery and onions and sauté until tender, about 6 minutes.

Add the walnuts and lentils along with the salt, water and jar of marinara. Stir to combine. Simmer on medium-low for 45 minutes stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens. Cook the pasta during this time.

When the lentils have reached your desired tenderness, transfer 2 cups of the sauce to a blender or food processor. Blend until nearly smooth. Add the blended sauce back to the pan and stir to combine. Blending is an optional step, but it helps add a creaminess without the need to add cream.

Remove from heat, and serve over your favorite pasta—such as pappardelle or tagliatelle—and top with freshly grated or vegan parmesan cheese.
