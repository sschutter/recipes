Banana Muffins II
-----

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg

- 3 large bananas, mashed
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 1 egg
- 1/3 cup butter (can maybe substitute olive oil)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- optional: nuts, chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat muffin pans with non-stick spray, or use paper liners. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg; set aside.

Combine bananas, sugar, egg, melted butter and vanilla in a large bowl. Fold in flour mixture, and mix until smooth. Scoop into muffin pans.

Bake in preheated oven. Bake mini muffins for 10 to 15 minutes, and large muffins for 25 to 30 minutes. Muffins will spring back when lightly tapped.
