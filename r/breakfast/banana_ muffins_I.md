Preheat over to 350 and butter 2 muffin tins. in a large bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, spices and salt; set aside.

Mash 2 of the bananas with a fork in a small bowl so they still have a bit of texture. With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, whip the remaining bananas and sugar together for a good 3 minutes. Add the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla and beat well. Donâ€™t forget to scrape down the sides of the bowl.

Mix in the dry ingredients just until incorporated. Fold in the nuts, chocolate chips and the mashed bananas with a rubber spatula. Spoon the batter into the muffin tins to fill them about halfway.
