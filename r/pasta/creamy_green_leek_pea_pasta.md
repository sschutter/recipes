Creamy Green Leek & Pea Pasta
-----

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 2 green onions, thinkly sliced
- 1 large leek, green tops removed, tailed, halved, washed, thinly sliced
-- can substitute for 1-2 medium onions
- 1 jalapeno, deseeded, minced
- 1 large head broccoli florets
- 1 teaspoon salt
<!-- -->
- 1 1/2 cups frozen peas
- 2/3 cup frozen spinach
- 1.2 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon dried mint
<!-- -->
- 4 cups fusilli pasta
- 1 cup full-fat coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon lemon

To a large pot on high heat, add the olive oil, and when hot, add in the garlic, green onion, leek, jalapeño, broccoli stems, and salt. Note, the salt here helps to draw the water our of the veggies, which helps it all cook faster. Cook this for 5 minutes, or until the leeks become soft and translucent. 

Then add the peas, spinach, basil, oregano, and mint, cooking for another 5 - 6 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to the package instructions, adding the broccoli florets in the last couple minutes. Just before draining it all, scoop out ½ cup (120 mL) cooking water from pasta and add to the veggie pan. Then drain the pasta and broccoli florets.

Add the cooking cream to the veggie pot, and stir to combine. You can leave this pasta sauce chunky as is, or make it smooth by blending it all up using an immersion blender or standing blender. We chose to blend about half of ours with an immersion blender, making it part-chunky and part-smooth. 

Add the pasta and broccoli to the sauce, along with the lemon juice, and toss to coat. Serve while hot, alongside some lemon wedges and garnished with fresh basil leaves.
