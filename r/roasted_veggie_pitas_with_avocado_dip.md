Roasted Veggie Pitas with Avocado Dip
-----

Avocado Dip:
- 2 ripe avocados
- 1-2 cloves garlic
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons water (more as needed)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- juice of one lime

Roasted Veggies:
- 2 heads cauliflower, cut into small florets
- 2 14-ounce cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 1-2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1-2 teaspoons garam masala
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper if you want spicy
- oil for drizzling
- salt and pepper to taste
- 8 small whole wheat pitas
- Greek yogurt for topping

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Pat the cauliflower and chickpeas dry with paper towels. Arrange in a single layer on one large baking sheet or two baking sheets. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with spices. Roast for 15-20 minutes, stir, and roast for an additional 15-20 minutes. The cauliflower and chickpeas should be golden brown and the chickpeas will be semi-crunchy.

While the veggies are roasting, puree the avocado dip ingredients in a food processor. Set aside.

Spread each pita with a spoonful of avocado dip and top with roasted veggies. Sprinkle with extra salt, pepper, and a dollop of Greek yogurt.
