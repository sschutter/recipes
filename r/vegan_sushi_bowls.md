Vegan Sushi Bowls
-----

- 1 medium carrot, scrubbed well and cut into ribbons with a vegetable peeler, then cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 medium cucumber
- 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons rice vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup uncooked sushi rice, rinsed in a colander until the water runs clear 
- 3/4 cup water
- 2 teaspoons sugar
<!-- -->
- 1 cup frozen shelled edamame
- 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
- 1/4 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon prepared wasabi paste or powder
<!-- -->
- 1 tablespoon oil, such as pure sesame oil or peanut oil
- 4 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, sliced
- 1/2 sheet sushi nori, cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips
- 1 scallion

To quickly pickle the veggies, toss together the cucumber, carrot, 2 tablespoons of the rice vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a medium bowl; let the mixture sit for at least 20 minutes while you make the remainder of the recipe. (You can also make these in advance and refrigerate.)

Stir together the rice and water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook, gently bubbling, for 15 to 20 minutes until the water is completely absorbed.

Stir together the remaining 2 teaspoons of rice vinegar, the sugar and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Remove the rice from the heat, then drizzle the salty-sweet vinegar mixture over the rice and stir it in. 

Fill a large skillet halfway with water, over medium heat. Once it is gently bubbling, add the edamame and cook until it becomes bright green and warmed through, about 3 minutes. Drain, then stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons of the soy sauce and the wasabi. The bowl will smell surprisingly spicy at first, but donâ€™t worry! The flavor mellows and has only a subtle kick.

Wipe out the same skillet you used for the edamame. Add the oil and the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of soy sauce. Heat the liquids over medium-high heat, then add the mushrooms and nori strips. Cook for 3 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender. Taste, and add salt as needed.

Place some cooked sushi rice in the bowl, artfully add small piles of pickles, edamame and mushrooms, and garnish with sliced scallions and spicy mayo. (Other optional garnishes, if you have them on hand: pickled ginger and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.)
