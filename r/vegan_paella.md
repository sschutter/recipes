Vegan Paella: Spanish-Inspired Rice
-----

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
<!-- -->
- 1 teaspoon sweet smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
<!-- -->
- 2 medium tomatos, diced
- 1 red bell pepper
<!-- -->
- 1 1/2 cups Spanish Paella Rice
- 4 cups boiling water
- 2 vegetable bouillon cubes
- 1 1/2 cup marinated artichokes from a jar, bite-sized pieces
- 1 cup frozen green peas, thawed

Add the olive oil to a large pan over medium-high heat, and when hot, add the onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook this for 2 - 3 minutes, or until the onions are translucent. Tip: try to use a pan that has a large cooking surface on the bottom of the pan. Try to avoid a wok-shaped pan, as the rice won't cook as evenly throughout.  

To the pan, add the paprika, thyme, cumin, oregano, and cayenne pepper. Cook this while stirring for 30 - 60 seconds, to toast the spices. 

Add in the tomatoes and bell pepper, saut√©ing for 2 - 3 minutes. 

Add the Paella rice, toasting this for 1 - 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.

To a large jug, mix the boiling water and vegetable cubes so that the cubes dissolve in the hot water. You could also substitute the bouillon cubes and water for 1L of vegetable stock instead. 

Add the liquid to the pan, but do not stir.

Bring the paella to a rapid simmer and let simmer for 2 minutes, then turn the heat to a low simmer and let cook uncovered for 20 - 30 minutes, or until the rice is tender.

When the liquid has been absorbed by the rice, use a spoon to give the rice a taste-test. Try to test the rice on the outer-most part of the pan, as this is the rice that will cook last given it's furthest away from the heat source in the centre. If the rice is firm but tender, it's ready. If the centre is still a bit raw, add a small splash of boiling water or hot stock, and let it continue to cook until the rice is cooked through. 

When the rice is cooked, add half of the artichoke hearts and peas to the rice, and gently stir it in. Add the other half on top, together with the 5 pieces of reserved bell pepper.

Remove the pan from the heat, cover the pan with a lid and let the Paella rest for 10 minutes. Do not skip this step, as it makes all the difference in taste and texture of the rice! Serve with lemon, chives, or parsley.
