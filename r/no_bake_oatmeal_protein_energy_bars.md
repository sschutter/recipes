No-Bake Oatmeal Protein Energy Bars
-----

- 1 1/2 cups rolled oats
- 1/2 cup vanilla whey protein powder (~2 scoops)
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup smooth natural peanut butter
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
<!-- -->
- 1/3 cup add-ins (raisins, chocolate chips, craisins, etc)
- 2-4 tablespoons liquid (almond milk, water, etc)
<!-- -->
- 2 teaspoons milk in second group of ingredients

Add oats, protein powder, cinnamon and chia seeds to a large bowl.

Add in peanut butter, honey and vanilla extract. Stir to combine.

Add in preferred add-in. Mixture should be slightly sticky but still crumbly.

Slowly add in liquid 1 tablespoon at a time and combine until it comes together in a sticky ball that holds together. If mixture is too dry, add in more liquid but not so much that it wonâ€™t hold shape.

Roll into balls using hands or push into 9x9 pan. Place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
