Roasted Sweet Potato Tacos
-----

- 1 batch refried beans (made with pinto or black beans)
- 1 pound sweet potatoes, diced into 1/2-inch cubes (also peeled, if desired)
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil (or olive oil)
- 2 teaspoons taco seasoning (homemade or store-bought)
- fine sea salt and ground black pepper
- 12 small corn tortillas or flour tortillas
- 1 avocado, peeled, pitted and thinly sliced
toppings: chopped white or red onion, chopped fresh cilantro, lime wedges and/or lime crema (ingredients below)
<!-- -->
- 1 cup sour cream or plain Greek yogurt
- lime juice
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- salt

Heat the oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  In a large mixing bowl, toss the sweet potatoes with the oil, taco seasoning, and a pinch of salt and black pepper until combined.  Spread the potatoes out on the prepared baking sheet in an even layer.  Bake for 25-35 minutes — flipping once halfway through, until the potatoes are tender and cooked through.

Meanwhile, while the potatoes are cooking, make a batch of refried beans according to recipe instructions.

To make the sauce, whisk the sour cream, lime juice, garlic powder and salt together until combined.

Once everything is cooked and ready to go, fill each tortilla with a scoop of refried beans, sweet potatoes, avocado, and any of your desired toppings.
