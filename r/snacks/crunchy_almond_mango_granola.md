Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). 

To a large bowl, add all oats, puffed quinoa, coconut, almonds, pumpkin seeds, brown sugar, and cinnamon, and give it a stir. 

To a separate medium bowl, add the oil, syrup, almond butter, vanilla, and salt. Whisk until it's all combined into a smooth caramel-like sauce. 

Pour this wet mix over the dry mix, and stir until all the dry mix is well coated. Transfer this mixture to a large parchment-lined baking tray and spread it out. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, or until lightly golden, stopping to give it a stir once halfway. 

Once removed from the oven, allow it to cool. It will continue to harden as it cools.

Once cooled, add the hemp or chia seeds and dried mango, toss, and place in an airtight container on the counter.
