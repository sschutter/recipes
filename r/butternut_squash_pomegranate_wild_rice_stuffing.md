Roasted Butternut Squash, Pomegranate, and Wild Rice "Stuffing"
-----

- 2 cups wild rice, rinsed

- 1 small-to-medium (2 to 2 ½ pounds) butternut squash, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
- 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt

- 4 ounces kale, ribs removed and chopped small (preferably the Tuscan variety, about ½ bunch or 2 cups)
- 3/4 cup chopped green onion (from 1 large or 2 medium bunches), divided
- Arils from 1 medium pomegranate, or ½ cup chopped dried cranberries

- 1/2 cup raw pepitas (green pumpkin seeds)
- 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 4 ounces goat cheese (about ⅔ cup crumbled)

Ginger dressing:
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy clean-up, if desired.

Cook the wild rice: Bring a large pot of water to boil (or see Instant Pot option provided in notes). Add the rinsed rice and continue cooking, reducing heat as necessary to maintain a lively simmer, for 40 minutes to 55 minutes. It’s done when the rice is pleasantly tender but still offers a light resistance to the bite. Remove from heat, drain the rice and return the rice to the pot.

Meanwhile, roast the butternut: Place the cubed butternut squash on your rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle it with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt. Toss until the cubes are lightly and evenly coated in oil. Arrange them in a single layer and roast for 35 to 50 minutes, tossing after 20 minutes, until they are starting to turn golden on the edges and tender when pierced through with a fork.

While the wild rice and butternut cook, prepare all of the remaining components. Chop the kale and green onion, remove the arils from the pomegranate, and whisk together all of the dressing ingredients in a small bowl.

To toast the pepitas, combine the pepitas, 1 teaspoon olive oil, ¼ teaspoon each salt and cinnamon in a small skillet. Stir to combine, and cook over medium heat until the pepitas are starting to turn golden on the edges and making little popping noises, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.

When the wild rice is finished cooking and still warm, stir in the kale, half of the green onions, and all of the ginger dressing. Spread the mixture over a large serving platter (or use a large serving bowl, if need be).

Arrange the butternut squash over the wild rice mixture. Crumble the goat cheese on top with a fork. Top with the pomegranate arils, toasted pepitas, and the remaining green onions. Serve.

This salad is good warm or at room temperature. It will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Gently reheat leftover servings in the microwave, if desired.
