-----

- 1 cup dried lentils (or 2 1/2 cups cooked)

- 1 small onion (~1 cup chopped)
- 8 oz cremini mushrooms (tough stems removed)
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
<!-- -->
- 1 1/2 Panko breadcrumbs
- 3 teaspoons Italien seasoning
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- 2 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs
- 1 cups parmesean cheese
<!-- -->
For serving:
- 2 lbs roma tomatoes
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- cooked pasta

If using dried lentils, place them into a small saucepan set over medium-high heat. Cover them plenty of with water, about 4 inches. Bring them to a boil before turning the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes, until they are tender but not mushy. Drain any excess water and set aside.

Pulse the mushrooms in a food processor until they are about the size of peas.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pan set over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the onion and sauté for about 3 minutes, until translucent. Add garlic and the pulsed mushrooms and sauté for 3-4 more minutes until the moisture has burned off and the garlic is fragrant.

Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the contents back into the food processor along with the lentils. Pulse until combined, about 20 pulses scraping down halfway through.

In a large bowl combine mushroom lentil mixture along with panko bread crumbs, 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning, cayenne, 1 ½ teaspoons salt, eggs and parmesan cheese and stir to combine.

Roll the mixture into 1 ½ (2 tablespoons) balls, about 24 and arrange them on another baking sheet.

Lightly brush or spray the meatballs with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil or cooking spray. Bake the meatballs and tomatoes for 30 minutes, rotating the 2 baking sheets and flipping the meatballs at the 15 minutes mark.

Once tomatoes and meatballs are roasted toss them together with cooked spaghetti, ¼ cup of olive oil, fresh basil and freshly grated parmesan cheese.

If serving with tomatoes: Preheat oven to 400°F. In a large bowl toss together tomato halves along with 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1 tsp of salt and 1/4 cup olive oil. Arrange tomatoes on a large baking sheet cut side up, set aside.
