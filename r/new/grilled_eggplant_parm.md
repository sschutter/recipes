Grilled Eggplant Parm
-----

- 1 cup canned crushed fire-roasted tomatoes
- 1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
- 1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic (a.k.a. garlic powder)
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil 
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
<!-- -->
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 medium eggplants, cut crosswise into six 3/4-inch rounds
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 2 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into small chunks (or 1/4 cup shredded)
- 4 fresh basil leaves, torn


Prepare your grill for medium-high direct heat (375 to 400 degrees). 

Stir together the canned tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, dried basil, dried oregano and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a medium bowl. 

Use the oil to brush each side of the eggplant slices, then season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Head out to your grill, with your trusty tomato sauce at your side (grab the cheeses, too). Place the eggplant directly on the grill grates and close the lid. Cook on each side for 5 to 7 minutes, until lightly browned and tender.

Keep the eggplant slices on the grill. Starting with the largest two eggplant slices, spread a spoonful of sauce and a modest sprinkling of Parm onto the top of the slice. Carefully stack another slice of eggplant on top and repeat: spread sauce and sprinkle cheese. Repeat again for a third layer of eggplant, sauce and Parm, then add the torn mozzarella cheese to the very top. 

And there you go! Youâ€™ve created two very elegant eggplant stacks. Close the lid and cook for 3 to 4 more minutes, until the cheeses have melted. Carefully transfer the eggplant stacks to plates and serve warm, topped with torn basil.
