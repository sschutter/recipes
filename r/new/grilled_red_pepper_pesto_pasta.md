Grilled Red Pepper Pesto Pasta
-----

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 red bell peppers, quartered
- 1 orange bell pepper
<!-- -->
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- pinch of ground black pepper
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1 zucchini, thinly sliced
- 400g dry spagetti noodles
- 1/4 roasted walnuts
- 1 1/2 frozen green peas
<!-- -->
- Garnish: fresh basil, fresh parsley, roasted walnuts

Add half the oil to a large pan on high heat. When hot, add the bell peppers, and sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper overtop.

Cook until the skin begins to blister, and then flip to cook on the other side. To speed up this recipe, you could alternatively skip this step and use roasted bell pepper from a jar.

When the bell peppers are cooked through and blistered on both sides, push them to the side of the pan, add a small bit more oil, and cook the garlic until lightly golden, about 2 - 3 minutes. Transfer both the bell pepper and garlic to a food processor or blender.

Return the same pan to the heat, and add more oil. When hot, cook the zucchini. Sprinkle over some salt and pepper, and try not to disturb the zucchini as it cooks, and give a flip only when golden.

To a large pot of salted boiling water, add the pasta.
Returning to the food processor, add in the sun-dried tomato, and walnuts. Blend until smooth, but some small chunks can remain, if desired.

In the last two minutes of the pasta cooking, add the peas to the cooking water. When the pasta is al dente, drain. Then return the drained pasta to the pot.

Add the cooked zucchini and blended red bell pepper mixture to the pot. Toss everything to coat.

One heated through, serve while hot. Garnish if desired, and enjoy!
