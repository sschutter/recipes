Pad Thai with Crispy Tofu
-----

- 4 ounces dried rice noodles
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons tamarind paste
- 3 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 3 tablespoons regular soy sauce, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon Sriracha 
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
<!-- -->
- 14 ounces extra-firm tofu
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons pure sesame oil
<!-- -->
- 1 medium orange bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- 1 watermelon radish, thinly sliced and cut into quarters (optional)
- 4 scallions, white and light-green parts thinly sliced on the diagonal
- 1 handful fresh bean sprouts
- 3 tablespoons crushed roasted unsalted peanuts

Prepare the rice noodles according to the package directions, then drain them. Most rice noodles simply require a quick soak in boiling water for a few minutes until they’re tender.

Whisk together the tamarind paste, water, maple syrup, soy sauce, Sriracha and garlic in a medium bowl until smooth.

Remove the block of tofu from its package and drain any liquid. Stand it on a short side and slice it in half lengthwise, then grab one half and crumble it into a bowl; this will be your scrambled-egg stand-in. Cut the remaining slab of tofu into rectangles about 1½ inches long and 1/2-inch thick. Place them on a clean dish towel or paper towel, and place another towel over the slices. Let them sit for 5 minutes.

Mix the cornstarch and kosher salt in a medium bowl. Toss each tofu slice in the cornstarch mixture until it’s coated well, then give each one a tap to shake off any excess coating.

Heat the oil until shimmering over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add the coated tofu slices in a single layer — don’t let them touch each other — and cook each side until browned and crisped, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Flip these babies using chopsticks, or any implement you like.

Add the bell pepper, radish slices and three-quarters of the scallions to the skillet. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the vegetables are softened. Reduce the heat to medium-low, then add the cooked noodles, pan-fried tofu, crumbled tofu and dump in the bowl with the sauce. Gently toss until the sauce coats everything and it is heated through, about a minute or two, then remove from the heat. Taste, and add a shake of soy sauce as needed. 

Divide the pad thai among bowls and top with the remaining scallions, bean sprouts and crushed peanuts.
