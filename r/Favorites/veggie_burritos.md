Veggie Burritos
-----

- 1/3 cup dried quinoa, rinsed as needed
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2/3 cup water
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
<!-- -->
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- 1/2 green bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- 2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced crosswise
- 4 ounces sliced cremini (baby bella) mushrooms
- One 15-ounce no-salt-added can pinto beans, including the liquid
- 1 tablespoon adobo from a can of chipotle chiles, or more as needed
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon granulated garlic (a.k.a. garlic powder)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- Two 9- or 10-inch flour tortillas
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1 cup baby spinach or other tender salad greens

Combine the quinoa, salt and water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat so that the water bubbles gently. Cover and cook for 13 to 15 minutes until all the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Turn off the heat and let stand covered for 5 minutes. Uncover and fluff with a fork, then stir in the lime juice.

Heat the olive oil until shimmering in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the red and green bell peppers, scallions and mushrooms. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until tender and slightly blackened, stirring occasionally.

Add the pinto beans and their liquid, the adobo, cumin, garlic powder and salt. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid thickens.

Warm the tortillas on a stovetop burner if desired. Fill and roll burritos.
