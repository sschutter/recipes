Vegetable Noodle Stir Fry with Peanut Lime Sauce
-----

- 175 g dry soba noodles (or udon, or rice)
<!-- -->
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 2 shallots minced (or 1 medium onion)
- 2 cloves minced garlic
<!-- -->
- 2 carrots, cut into matchsticks or shredded
- 2 red bell peppers, julienned
- 1/4 head red cabbage (or mushrooms, sugar snap peas, green beans)
<!-- -->
- 3/4 cup roasted cashews
- 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro (optional)

Cook noodles in a large pot according to package instructions until al dente.

Add the oil to a large pan on medium-high heat. When hot, add the shallots and garlic and cook for about 2 minutes, or until lightly golden. Add splashes of water to deglaze the pan as needed.

Add the carrots, bell peppers, and cabbage to the pan, and cook for 2 minutes more, until bright and heated up, but still crunchy. Add more splashes of water as needed.

Meanwhile, add all sauce ingredients to a mason jar, and mix or shake to combine into a creamy sauce.

When the noodles are cooked, drain and add to the pan of vegetables and pour the sauce mixture on top. Toss to combine.

Serve with the roasted cashews, fresh cilantro, and lime wedges. Enjoy!
