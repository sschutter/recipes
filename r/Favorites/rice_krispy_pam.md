Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Crispy Rice Treats: Pam recipe
-----

- 1/2 cup honey
- 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter
- 2/3 semisweet chocolate chips
- 5 cups crispy brown rice cereal

Combine the honey and peanut butter in a large microwave safe bowl and heat it on high in the microwave for bursts of 30 seconds. Stir in the chocolate chips and then the brown rice cereal, coating it evenly.

Grease a 9-by-13-inch shallow baking dish with cooking oil spray. Transfer the rice mixture to the baking dish. Lay a piece of plastic wrap over it to prevent your hands from sticking as you press the mixture evenly and firmly into the pan.

Cover and refrigerate for 40 minutes, until set, then cut into pieces.
