Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Crispy Rice Treats
-----

- 1/2 cup honey
- 3/4 cup natural-style smooth peanut butter
- 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips (may substitute chopped dried fruit)
- 5 cups crispy brown rice cereal

Combine the honey and peanut butter in a large pot over medium-low heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until melted. Remove from the heat. Stir in the chocolate chips and then the brown rice cereal, coating it evenly.

Grease a 9-by-13-inch shallow baking dish with cooking oil spray. Transfer the rice mixture to the baking dish. Lay a piece of plastic wrap over it to prevent your hands from sticking as you press the mixture evenly and firmly into the pan.

Cover and refrigerate for 40 minutes, until set, then cut into 15 equal pieces.
