Honey Garlic baked Cauliflower
-----

- 1 small head of cauliflower
- 2 cups panko bread crumbs
- cooking oil spray
- 2 large eggs
- 2 green onions
<!-- -->
- 6 tablespoons honey
- 4 garlic cloves minced
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 6 tablespoons water
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 1/2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
- 1/2 tablespoon sriracha sauce 

Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Spread panko crumbs in a thin even layer across the surface of the baking sheet. Spray panko crumbs with cooking oil spray. Bake crumbs about 5-7 minutes or until golden brown. 

Whisk eggs in a small bowl. Dip cauliflower in egg mixture and then shake a few times so that excess egg drips off. You don't want to dampen your breadcrumbs with excess egg because then they won't stick to the cauliflower. Then place into sheet with panko crumbs. Cover cauliflower with panko, pressing the crumbs gently against the cauliflower to help them stick. Place coated cauliflower on empty prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all cauliflower is coated.

Bake for about 15-20 minutes or until cauliflower is cooked and the coating is a dark golden brown.
