Mediterranean Cauliflower Platter
-----

- 1 large head cauliflower (2 pounds), cored and cut into florets
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest (from 1/2 lemon)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
<!-- -->
- 3/4 cup dried quinoa, rinsed as needed
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1/2 cup chopped cherry tomatoes
- 1/2 medium red bell pepper, seeded and minced (1/2 cup)
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from the lemon you zested above)
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- Freshly ground black pepper
<!-- -->
- 1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 clove garlic
- 3/4 cup canned ripe green olives, drained
- dried thyme
<!-- -->
- 1 cup hummus
- 1 English (seedless) cucumber, thinly sliced crosswise
- Handful roasted, salted almonds
- Two pitas, cut into wedges
- Sweet paprika (optional)

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

Toss together the cauliflower, oil, thyme, cumin, turmeric, lemon zest and salt in a mixing bowl until evenly coated, then spread in a single layer on the baking sheet. Roast until fork-tender, about 25 minutes.

Quinoa salad: Combine the quinoa, salt and water in a medium saucepan. Bring it to a boil, then cover and cook, gently bubbling, for 13 to 17 minutes, until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. (If making ahead, refrigerate until serving.) Transfer the quinoa to a medium bowl and mix it with the parsley, cherry tomatoes, red bell pepper, lemon juice, oil and black pepper. Taste, and add more salt as needed. The salt should perfectly balance the pop of the lemon.

The olives: Combine the oil and garlic in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook for 1 minute, then add the olives and cook for 5 minutes until warmed through, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Add the thyme, crushing it with your fingers as you sprinkle it over the olives. (You can skip this and go with straight-up olives in a pinch, but it adds great flavor with minimal effort.)

When you're ready to assemble, arrange the roasted cauliflower, quinoa salad, olives, hummus, cucumber slices, almonds and pita wedges on a platter. Garnish the hummus with paprika, if desired.
