Drain and rinse the chickpeas and set aside. Add minced garlic to a saute pan with the avocado or olive oil. Saute for a few minutes.

In a small bowl, blend the arrowroot powder and 2 tablespoons of the vegetable broth.

In the saute pan add tamari, toasted sesame oil, maple syrup, rice vinegar, ginger, and the other 2 tablespoons of vegetable broth. Add the arrowroot powder and stir. When bubbles begin to form, add the chickpeas. Cook on low heat until the sauce becomes thick and sticky (about 5 minutes).
