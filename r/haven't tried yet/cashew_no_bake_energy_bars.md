Cashew No Bake Energy Bars
-----

- 2 cups Medjool dates (~20)
- 3/4 cup cashews
- 1/2 cup almonds
- 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 pinch kosher salt

Remove the pits from the dates. In the bowl of a food processor, add the dates, cashews, almonds, cinnamon, vanilla, kosher salt, and ½ tablespoon of water. Process until combined and a sticky dough forms, with large chunks of nuts.

Spread the dough into an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Then use a glass to roll over the top to a uniform thickness, about ½ inch thick. Freeze for 15 minutes until set, then cut into rectangles.
