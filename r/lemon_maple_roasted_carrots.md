Lemon-Maple Roaster Carrots
-----

- 2 1/2 lb carrots
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons coriander seeds, crushed
- kosher salt
- pepper
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves


Heat oven to 450°F. Peel carrots, halve crosswise, and cut the thick ends in half lengthwise, if large.

On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss carrots with oil, coriander seeds, and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Transfer half to a second sheet, reduce oven temperature to 425°F and roast, tossing after 15 minutes, until golden brown and tender, 20 to 25 minutes total.

Immediately toss hot carrots with maple syrup, then lemon juice. Serve topped with cilantro
