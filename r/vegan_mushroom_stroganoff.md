One Pot Mushroom Stroganoff
-----

- 1 small yellow onion
- 10oz baby bella mushrooms
- 4 cups dry rotini pasta
- 4 cups veggie broth (beef flavored optional)
- 2 tbsp nutrititonal yeast
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/3 cup cashew butter
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- salt and parsley to taste
<!-- -->
- 2 teaspoons milk in second group of ingredients

Peel your onion, cut it in half, and then thinly slice it into half “rings.” Cut onion into halfs or fourths, depending on size. You want to keep the Mushrooms relatively large, as they will shrink when cooking and are meant to imitate beef in this recipe.

Pour a splash of water to a large pot over medium heat. Add in the sliced onion and cook until translucent, about 3-5 minutes.

Add in the Pasta, Mushrooms, Beef-flavored Broth, Nutritional Yeast, and Black Pepper. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan.

Turn the heat off, then stir in the Cashew Butter and Lemon Juice until everything is well incorporated. Taste the pasta and add any additional Salt, if necessary.

Top with freshly chopped Parsley and Black Pepper, and serve warm. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to one week.
