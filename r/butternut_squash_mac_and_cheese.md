Butternut Squash Mac and Cheese
-----

1 pound cubed butternut squash
10 ounces whole wheat elbow pasta

1 ½ cups low sodium vegetable broth, divided
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon garlic powder
Salt and black pepper, to taste

¼ cup panko breadcrumbs
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese

1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 medium shallot, minced
¼ cup all-purpose flour
2 cups skim milk

½ cup shredded gruyere cheese
½ cup shredded cheddar cheese
Chopped chives, optional, for garnish

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a 9” x 11” glass baking dish with oil and set aside.

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add squash and boil until tender, 5-6 minutes.

When fork tender, transfer squash with a slotted spoon to a blender.

Add pasta to boiling water and cook according to package directions. When cooked, drain and put back into the pot.

Meanwhile, add ½ cup vegetable broth, onion powder, garlic powder, ½ teaspoon salt and pepper to the blender with the squash. Blend until smooth and creamy.

In a small bowl, combine breadcrumbs, Parmesan, ¼ teaspoon salt and pepper. Set aside.

Melt the butter in a medium sauce pot over medium heat. Add the shallots and sauté 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour evenly over the shallots and cook another minute. Add the remaining 1 cup broth and milk and whisk to combine. Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and cook 5 minutes, whisking frequently.

Remove pot from heat and whisk in cheese, pureed squash, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. Add sauce to noodles, gently mix to combine, then transfer mixture to prepared baking dish.

Sprinkle with breadcrumb mixture and bake 25 minutes. Switch oven to high broil and broil for 2-3 minutes, or until crumbs are starting to brown.
