Best Vegan Nutella
-----

- 1 1/2 cups raw hazelnuts
- 1/3 cup unsweetened soy/plant milk
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 6 soft dates, pitted
- 1/3 cup cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
<!-- -->

Preheat the oven to 350 F/ 180 C. Spread the hazelnuts onto a cookie sheet with baking paper underneath and bake for 10-12 minutes, until lightly golden and fragrant, stirring once halfway. 

Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Then pickup handfuls at a time and rub firmly between your palms so the skin falls off. Alternatively, you can rub them in a clean kitchen cloth. Toss the hazelnuts back and forth between both hands so the skin falls from between your fingers. Place the peeled hazelnuts in a high-speed blender or food processor. 

Blend on high for 5 minutes, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides, until a thin nut butter consistency is formed. 

Add the remaining ingredients and blend again for an additional 3-5 minutes until smooth and well incorporated. Store in an airtight jar in the fridge.
